## About Git-LFS

To make this repository publicly available on Github, it is not possible to use Git-LFS. Consider renaming .gitattributes_off to .gitattributes and properly setup Git-LFS as explained at https://git-lfs.com/.
You may be required to remove and re-add files with the extension .uasset and .umap.
